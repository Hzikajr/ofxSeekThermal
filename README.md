# ofxSeekThermal
simple addon to use SeekThermal compact thermo cam in openframeworks app

## Mega thanks:
maartenvds's amazing repo
https://github.com/maartenvds/libseek-thermal

## tested on:
MacBook Pro (15-inch, Mid 2014), OSX 10.12.6, oF0.9.8

## TODO:
- add a function to make "flat field" to calibrate camera input
- support open/close capability of seek camera while an ofApp is running
- add SeekCompactPro device support

## you might need to do...
compile original libseek-thermal library on your environment because the attached one was compiled on my macintosh system.
